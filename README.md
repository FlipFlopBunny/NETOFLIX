# NETOFLIX
This used to be a group project that I made with 2 other friends for our Web development class at IFSC. 
We were asked to build a website using a REST API using HTML5, CSS3, PHP and JavaScript.
Our initial goal was to build a simple website with the IMDb API that would allow users to create a list of favorite movies.

## Here are some things I wish we included if we had more time to work on this project:
- User can create multiple movie lists and name them
- When the cards are clicked, a page with the synopsis and other info comes up
- In terms of UX, it is not super obvious that you have to click on the heart in order to favorite. It gives the impression that the whole card is clickable.
- The register page takes the user back to index.php with the user automatically signed in

## Some ideas to make this project really awesome!
- Safer register and log in process
- Build a forum where users can talk about the movies
